    <p>
        Pork belly is a fatty piece of meat that is often used 
        to make bacon and pancetta. However, it can also be roasted, 
        resulting in flavorful and tender pork covered with delicious
        crackling. It's that dual texture (often in a single bite) 
        that makes it irresistible and guaranteed to please 
        everyone at the dinner table.

        <li>Heat the oven to 350 F/180 C. Place the rack on a 
            rimmed baking sheet. With a sharp knife, make several 
            parallel cuts across the skin of the pork belly, 
            1/4 to 1/2-inch apart. Cut through the skin and 
            fat but not into the meat.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the pork all over with kosher salt and freshly 
            ground black pepper. 
            Drizzle with olive oil and rub it all into the pork.</li>
        <img src="../images/3rdstep.jpg">
        <li>Place the pork on the rack, skin-side up</li>
        <img src="../images/4thstep.jpg">
        <li>Roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender and 
            falling apart. Increase the heat to 425 F and 
            roast for 20 to 25 minutes longer to crisp the skin even more.</li>
        <img src="../images/5thstep.jpg">
        <li>Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10 mins before
            slicing. 
        </li>
